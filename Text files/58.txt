The bed was extremely comfortable. The staff was always smiled, polite and helpful. The food in the Chinese restaurant and roof bar next to the pool was to die for. The service - brilliant. Having a cocktail while enjoying the jacuzzi jacuzzi was so relaxing ðŸ˜Œ. The life piano performance at hotel lobby night time was amazing!
