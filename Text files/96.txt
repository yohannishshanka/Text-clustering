Quality of food is very poor and in spite of the friendly restaurant staff the customer service is not good. I had two very bad meals (one missing most of the ingredients and the other stone cold yet overcooked to the point of being inedible)but just got smiles and shrugs. The rooms and bathrooms need a good clean.
