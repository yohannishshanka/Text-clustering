The breakfast was ok,not outstanding but acceptable,lunch buffet was basically the same,just added some roasted fish and chicken.The Chinese restaurant though was a horror experience and a big dissapoinent
for me,never call this chinese cuisine.It was sri lankan-indian food ,perhaps with some chinese fusion.Food was cold,i found a hair in my soup as well and staff was rude and indifferent,no apology or saying sorry! The coffee shop @ lobby area ground floor ,was nice to hang out,habing a drink and listening to piano tunes in the evening.The mall on the roof was small,but had a food court and several small outlets to shop gifts etc.Overall a good experience except the annoying experience of the chinese restaurant i mentioned!
