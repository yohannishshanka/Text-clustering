 beautiful room and a wonderful host. Our host was on the property and we felt as if he was our own butler. He was there in the morning to greet us and serve us our breakfast . He was delightful and was ever so helpful. The room was very spacious and it does have a British cottage type of appeal . I grew up in a cottage in the north of England and it reminds me of that.
