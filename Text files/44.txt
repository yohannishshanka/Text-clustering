he location is great they arranged taxi pick from the airport
Was hassle free the whole experience was incredible time everyone works so so hard from reception to security to waiters in the restaurant the pool team
I canâ€™t thank them enough for their hard work and hospitality highly recommend it to stay in if you visiting Colombo
