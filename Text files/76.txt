We stayed in a quadruple-type room. Very friendly staff. Room services are simply amazing. They are serving a healthy breakfast with fruits, hotdogs, eggs, and some healthy protein stuff. Airport Pickup and Drop up services are good and they are on time. The location is really amazing and you can find restaurants nearby.
