Amazing place, very clean and beautiful. Rooms are well equipped, it is a high standard for the price. The restaurant serves excellent food, everybody who is working is so kind and helpful. For example, the owner even drove me to the bank in the city when the nearby ATM swallowed my card and tried to help as much as he could. Very close to the nice beach, shop, fruit stand and other restaurants.
Warm regards to the owner and all the employees and thanks for such a great stay :)
