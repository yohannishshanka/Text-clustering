 I was concerned because other reviews said the same thing, but within 30 minutes of our arrival we found a small chavana cockroach in our room (even though we were staying in a superior room). We contacted the hotel front desk and they brought us insecticide, but the response was slow, plus they suspected that we had opened the window in our room (even though we didn't actually open it).
