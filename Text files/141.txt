 We went to a few restaurants for local food for lunch but had most of the dinners at the villa the curries and fresh fish catched in the morning where the most tasty we had at our whole stay. I personally canâ€™t complain about anything. We had a room upstairs with a perfect view two chairs and a small table to enjoy the evenings, but we actually preferred to have some drinks, lot of Carrom games and good nights with friends and family of Indika. It was really hard to leave at the end of our vacations, but we will for sure come back. Thank you so much for making our vacations such an awesome experience, we are going to miss all of you.
