The included city tour was a great benefit and well down. Breakfast was very good and had lots of international choices to accommodate various cultures. The most amazing thing is the roof top pool that seems to blend with the sea. There are some restaurants and pretty fashion shops around if you donâ€™t want to eat at the hotel. I would love to stay again even if only for the rooftop pool!
