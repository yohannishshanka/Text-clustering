The location is fantastic, an average of 15 min drive to most of the must see sites and restaurants in Colombo. The staff was very friendly and helpful especially Siggit who accompanied me to Dambula and Kandy.
Forgot my wallet at the cafe in the lobby and the ladies working the counter kept it safe and absolutely nothing was missing!
Definetely recommend for solo or family trip.
