The hotel and the room exceeded our expectations based on the pictures and reviews we saw beforehand. The hotel was cozy and the room was tidy and quite well equipped. The owner spoke good English and was friendly and helpful. The hotel was close to the beach but far enough from the road that the we couldn't hear the noise. The breakfast was plentiful and tasty.
