Big rooms and a great location. Staff were very accommodating and friendly. Customer service was fabulous. The Bar and restaurant was really lovely and food very nice.
Location being across the road from Dutch Hospital is great, lovely restaurant to try there. All the restaurants we tried were fabulous.
