The rooms were extremely comfortable with a gorgeous view, the pool area was stunning & was lovely to have jacuzzi & sauna’s available also. We ate in 3 restaurants, lunch on the pool terrace, dinner at their Chinese restaurant & breakfast on 2 mornings & the food in all 3 was absolutely delicious. We also done a complimentary city tour on one of the hotel’s mini bus which was excellent. I definitely would recommend the Marino beach again.
