Our room had a horrid, strong smell of damp. After moving the curtains we could see damp/mould in the window area. All grouting in bathroom was black with mould. The smell was horrid and damp. We was moved to the suite upstairs (which although it did not smell of damp, it is in definite need of a revamp - especially the seating area near the jacuzzi, the cushions were stained) but was told that we could not use its bathroom nor toilet and had to use the damp ridden rooms bathroom. Me and my mum were trying to find alternative accommodation at 23:30 but unfortunately we could not find a driver to take us there. We even tried to book accommodation across the road but they were closed. This experience was so traumatic especially considering I was in a different country. We had high hopes for this hotel and was the last of hotels we stayed at in Sri Lanka, itâ€™s sad that we left this amazing country on this experience.
