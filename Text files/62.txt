The Marino is very beautiful and luxurious. The staff are super friendly and helpful. The rooftop pool and spas and bar are a beautiful oasis... and the staff are constantly maintaining it so it stays very clean. The restaurant's buffet was absolutely delicious with so much variety. I highly recommend this hotel.
