True to its name, this Little England cottage is extremely cosy, well maintained and has the best property manager - Nalaka. We were here for our anniversary and stayed at the most aesthetic loft room with the Jacuzzi. I must say that Nalaka planned out some amazing surprises for us. Right from decorating the room to getting us a midnight cake, he ensured that we had the best time at Kent cottage. The breakfast served was also delicious. Overall,a big thumbs up from our side. We would love to come back here and certainly recommend the property for everyone looking to spend some peaceful, memorable time at Nuwara Eliya.
