Guest services were good and they had kept everything into consideration at that price point i guess like restaurant service, good touch by keeping mid night snacks stalls near reception, cafeteria with 24 hr free water, tea and coffee where you just had to go there and help yourself. Well recommend !!!! Exceptional!!!!
