The property is right on the beach. The breeze and the waves were wonderful. We had the tree house with a balcony. The balcony was with a good view. There is a restaurant at the property. The menu is not big, mainly western tourists food. The bar had a nice music and vibe. The music stops around 11 pm so you can sleep. People were very friendly.
You can take the bus from across the street for about 75r to go to Galle. 1300-1400r for a tuk tuk to the rail station.
