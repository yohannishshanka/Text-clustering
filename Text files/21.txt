A decent hotel facing the beach, the Mirage suffers a little from its maintainence and upkeep. The room furniture is dated and looks past its refurbishment date. The breakfast spread is good and the dining room has great views. The pool is small and barely ok for a few laps. The staff is polite and smiling and try their best to sort out issues.
