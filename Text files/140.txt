Falling asleep and waking up to the sounds of the Indian Ocean in a clean and comfortable space was fantastic. We stayed in one of the beach homes, which was a private room with private bathroom and a balcony. We enjoyed dinner and a beer in the restaurant as well. The staff was welcoming and attentive and the food was good. If we were to change anything during our vacation, we would add one more night here.
