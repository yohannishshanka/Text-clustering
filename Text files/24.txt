We felt like a bit of hotel-style luxury for our final night in Sri Lanka without paying Shangri-La prices, Mirage was perfect. They upgraded us for free to a double sea view room which had THE most amazing views, there is basically nothing between your bed a a huge open sea horizon view, plus the room was absolutely massive for the price we paid
- Staff organised us a cheap and efficient Airport transfer and were generally really nice, it's about 45 - one hour from the main airport
- We did not have breakfast or eat here so can't comment on that
- The infinity pool overlooking the sea was a great addition
- It was great value for a one night stop over before a flight
