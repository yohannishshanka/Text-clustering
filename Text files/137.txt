 Very cute little hut, right by the beach. As soon as we saw it, we asked to book a second night. Our hut was clean and comfortable and had a mosquito net, fan and enough space to store our rucksacks. The bar/restaurant area is a great backpacker spot. The perfect place to relax by the beach. Although it is a little way from Galle centre and the Fort, there is a bus stop right outside and buses go past very frequently. There are a couple of similar spots along the same stretch of beach so you have a choice of places to eat and drink. The staff were all very friendly, laid back and welcoming.
