The hotel is a perfect accommodation for a long stay in Unawatuna. The beach is just across the road, next to the hotel you can find lots of shops and restaurants. The staff is absolutely kind and supportive, during our stay we feel completely like at home. The rooms are clean and cozy with the air conditioning, TV, mini-fridge and kettle. The cleaning is provided everyday with the new towels and bath stuff. You can also order meals in the restaurant including the fresh seafood for dinner. Our room was with the terrace to where we could also order the meals. I am completely excited about our stay in Happy Night and want to thank all the staff for the unique atmosphere that made our holiday unforgettable. Wait to come back soon!
