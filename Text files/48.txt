The property is awesome, facing the beach which gives a calm feeling. Rooms are so big and comfortable with balcony where you can see the sea. 2nd floor (Tide Restaurant) breakfast place is awesome, the buffet was superb. Rooftop pool is mindblowing which has so much greenery on the top including a rooftop bar for the people to unwind.
Most importantly, the staff are so kind and helpful, smiling always. From the entrance, front desk, at the 2nd floor tide restaurant, room service, cleaners and rooftop guys. As they say, kindness goes a long way.
